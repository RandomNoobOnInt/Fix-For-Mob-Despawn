# Fix-For-Mob-Despawn

Adds a fix for mob despawning in Ians farm on multiplayer servers with other players online.

# How it works?
Use "/loadchunk add" to add the chunk where the mobs teleport to (in the overworld). This will make them not despawn. "Just add the chunks where the portal is made, the bridge chunks need not to be added." 

# Possible Issues:
The plugin makes the mobs unable to despawn when they come throught a `loaded chunks` potal, they might count to mob cap. I havent thought of any possible fixes for this becuase the chances of this happening is quite low. May add a fix a later.

List of commands:
/loadchunk help
/loadchunk list

Below commands work on the chunk the player is currently standing on.
/loadchunk add
/loadchunk remove 

English is not my first language soo please excuse any mistakes.
